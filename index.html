                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Abhidyu C. Shetty, currently in my 2nd year of B.Tech in Computer Science (Full Stack Development) at NMAM Institute of Technology, Karkala. I’m passionate about coding and exploring new technologies in the field of software development. My current focus is on enhancing my skills in full-stack development, with a special interest in both front-end and back-end technologies. Along with academics, I’m always looking for opportunities to apply my learning in real-world projects, whether through internships, hackathons, or personal projects. Outside of studies, I enjoy problem-solving, collaborating with peers, and learning new programming languages to broaden my skill set. Looking forward to growing both as a developer and as an individual during my time at NMAMIT!</p>
